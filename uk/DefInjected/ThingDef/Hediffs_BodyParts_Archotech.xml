  <!-- EN: archotech arm -->
  <ArchotechArm.label>архотечна рука</ArchotechArm.label>
  <!-- EN: An artifical arm built by an archotech. It's strong enough to crush a thick hardwood branch in its hand, and precise enough to write a sonnet on a grain of rice. It looks and feels like natural flesh, but it's harder to damage than plasteel. Even if it is harmed, it repairs itself over time. Its internal workings are a mystery to all human minds. -->
  <ArchotechArm.description>Штучна рука, сконструйована архотехом. Достатньо сильна, щоб зламати товсту гілку з дерева твердих сортів в ладоні, і досить точна, щоб написати сонету на зернятці рису. Вона виглядає і відчувається, як природна плоть, але її важче пошкодити, ніж пласталь. І навіть якщо її прошкодити, вона відновить себе з часом. Принцип її роботи - загадка для людського розуму.</ArchotechArm.description>
  
  <!-- EN: archotech eye -->
  <ArchotechEye.label>архотечне око</ArchotechEye.label>
  <!-- EN: An artifical eye built by an archotech. It perceives every type of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves, infrared, light, x-rays, and gamma rays. Its visual acuity is precise enough to read handwriting from twenty meters away. It can emit various wavelengths of radiation like a flashlight, and has an internal subpersona AI which helps highlight useful visual information. Externally, it looks like a natural human eye, except it can change color at will. Its internal workings are a mystery to all human minds. -->

Even if it is harmed, it repairs itself over time. Its internal workings are a mystery to all human minds. -->
